# TimeTracker Textmate Bundle

This is a personal project to get myself (and whoever else wants to use it) a simple way to keep records of time spent on projects.

This is not yet ready for primetime.

# Known Bugs

- A lot of things will change. It is OK to save the data in a non-tallied state, but don't save the data in a tallied state yet. Too much might change that may make old files hard to read/manage.
- can't yet cross noon or midnight gracefully unless a/p is appended to the times that are affected. That whole part sorely needs to be rewritten.
